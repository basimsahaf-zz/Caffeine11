# Caffeine
An app that makes roads safe for you and for everyone!

#Motivation behind the hack:

•100,000 police-reported crashes are the direct result of driver fatigue each year.

•This results in an estimated 1,550 deaths and 71,000 injuries 

•Results $12.5 billion in monetary losses.

#What the hack does: 

•Using the Muse headband, we aim to prevent drivers from dozing off while they are driving. 

•Reminds drivers to not use their phones while driving. 

•We do this by causing a sound and a vibration to trigger whenever needed.


#How our hack works: 

•The Muse Headband provides us with real-time brainwave and accelerometer data. 

•We created an android app that receives this data from the Headband. 

•We then use this data to track head-position in 3D and monitor brain activity. 

•Based on this, we calculate when to trigger the alarm system to alert the driver. 

•The alarm system automatically turns off when the driver regains alertness.


#Future? 

•Our biggest market would be Uber and Lyft. Worth more than USD 70 billion, they are the biggest players in the cab industry.   In case of accidents, they are liable to pay up to USD 1 million . Our product can save them tons of money every year. 

•We can also expand to the consumer market enabling hundreds of thousands of people to drive home safe everyday.
